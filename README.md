# Modelling-of-Large-datasets-of-fractal-like-3D-models-to-train-GAN
This strategy of Rhino | Grasshopper pipeline introduces the generation of fractals-like meshes in 3D to obtain a large amount of user-defined OBJ files. It builds upon a C# script inside Rhino Grasshopper interface which produces intricate and complex fractal-like structures, based on Mesh Normal Vector manipulation and recursion. Then, the design space is explored implementing the DSE addon by MIT, to deliver a series of parameters setup for the core script and finally the design space is stored as OBJ file utilising Python script to write OBJ files. The OBJ writing strategy was introduced in the Digital Futures 2021 workshop by Diego Pinochet.
